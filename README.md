# Numerical Optimization Dashboard
This is an interactive educational dashboard that applies different numerical optimization algorithms to solve a simple linear regression problem.
The regression problem fits a line to some toy data for the purpose of illustration.
The dashboard allows the user to try different numerical optimization algorithms, tune its hyperparameters, and see the effects of his choices using different useful visualizations and animations that illustrate the effect of the user's choices on the loss function value, the learned parameters values, and the regression line throughout the training process.
